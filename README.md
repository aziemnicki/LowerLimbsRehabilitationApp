# Lower Limbs Rehabilitation App

## Repository Overview

This GitHub repository contains the source code for an augmented reality (AR) application designed to support lower limb rehabilitation. The application leverages AR technology to create an interactive and engaging environment for patients undergoing rehabilitation, aiming to improve their recovery process through visual and interactive feedback.

## Code Summary

The repository includes several scripts that contribute to the functionality of the AR application. Two key scripts are `detections.cs` and `collisions.cs`, each playing a specific role in the application's operation.

### `detections.cs`

The `detections.cs` script is responsible for detecting features within the AR environment. In the context of this application, feature detection is crucial for identifying and tracking the position and movement of the user's lower limbs. This script likely utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze the video feed and recognize specific markers or patterns that correspond to the user's movements. By accurately detecting these features, the application can provide real-time feedback and adjustments to the rehabilitation exercises, ensuring they are performed correctly and effectively.

### `collisions.cs`

The `collisions.cs` script handles collision detection within the AR environment. Collision detection is a computational process used to identify when two or more objects intersect or come into contact. In this application, collision detection ensures that virtual elements, such as visual cues or interactive objects, do not incorrectly overlap with each other or with the user's body in a way that could disrupt the rehabilitation process. By managing these interactions, the script helps maintain a realistic and safe environment for the user to perform their exercises.

## Application in Lower Limb Rehabilitation

The AR application is designed to enhance the rehabilitation process for patients with lower limb injuries or conditions. By integrating AR, the application provides several benefits:

- **Interactive Feedback**: The application offers real-time visual feedback, helping patients understand their movements and adjust them as needed to improve their rehabilitation outcomes.
- **Engagement**: The use of AR makes the rehabilitation exercises more engaging, which can increase patient motivation and adherence to the rehabilitation program.
- **Precision**: The feature detection and collision management ensure that exercises are performed accurately, reducing the risk of improper movements that could hinder recovery.

Overall, this AR-based rehabilitation tool aims to provide a more effective and enjoyable recovery experience for patients, leveraging technology to support and enhance traditional rehabilitation methods.
